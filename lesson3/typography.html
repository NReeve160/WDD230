            <h2>Header Typography: Abyssinica SIL serif</h2>
            <p>The place I have chosen is from a fictional place from a fictional
                podcast. It is based on in a fantasy setting, and for some reason
                I just think that headers that are fantasy connected should be 
                serif fonts. I wanted to chose a serif that wasn't overly swirly
                or fancy though, since The Crick folk are a pretty simple folk.
                I was able to find this font that looks nice and has some very 
                simple serifs, but still looks like it could easily be written. 
            </p>

            <h2>Paragraph Typography: Font-Family: Ubuntu Sans Serif</h2>
            <p>I chose this one because I wanted a sans seriff font for the type of 
                the page. I did this because The Crick folk are simple. I didn't think
                they would want anything to complicated for hte type. I stuck with Ubuntu
                because it is pretty well spaced between the words and comfortable beteween
                the letters. I think that this makes it much more readable in large
                chunks. Most of the informational websites is clumped together, so readability 
                extremely important.</p>
