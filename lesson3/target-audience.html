            <h2>Persona #1: The tourist</h2>
            <p>Many young people like to come to The Crick in order to explore and 
                reconnect with nature. They will typically be between the ages of 22 
                to 35. They are attracted to The Crick because it is a affordable 
                vacation destination that still has beautiful scenery in the Living 
                Wood. Many of them are have only finished the minimum education 
                requirements of their area, but some who are working on their continued 
                education will come as well during time off of school. Those who do this 
                will mostly be looking at the website through their Speaking Stones (Cell 
                Phones). They are looking up places to visit, and historical information 
                on The Crick. </p>

            <h3>Personal #1 Scenario #1</h3>
            <p>A young recently married couple has decided to spend their honeymoon in the 
                Crick. They are well aware of the reputation for hospitality, but they were 
                just curious and wanted to learn a little bit about the history of The Crick. 
                The Chamber of Commerce is able to provide an overview of both the older 
                history and recent history of The Crick. </p>

            <h3>Persona #1 Scenario #2</h3>
            <p>A young single woman is looking to see if it would be a good place for her to 
                spend a weekend. She wants to make sure that it is a safe place for her and 
                to know if it is the type of place that will let her enjoy a little bit of 
                nature. When looking at The Crick Commerce site they can get an idea of the 
                culture that exist in the Crick. Once she looks, she will be able to see that 
                The Crick is especially known for its hospitality, though not necessarily for 
                its safety. </p>

            <h3>Persona #1 Scenario #3</h3>
            <p>A group of potential adventurers were inspired by the stories of the Heroes of 
                Bahumia. Since Moonshine Cybine is from the Crick they decided, they were going 
                to begin as adventures at The Crick. This is an ideal place to begin since many 
                of the people who are at the Crick are former high-level adventurers. Specifically, 
                the Leader of the Crick, Maw Maw Gump, is well known for her adventuring skills. 
                They decided to use the Chamber of Commerce site in order to find out a little more 
                about the people and who they can reach out to about becoming adventurers. </p>

            <h2>Persona #2: The magical researcher</h2>
            <p>Magical researchers developed The Crick and its potential connection to the 
                Fey Wild in recent years. As they have started to investigate this connection, 
                they have referenced the chamber of commerce website more frequently when 
                planning topography and magical study sites. They are interested in knowing 
                what types of accommodations they can find, places that have a high magical 
                density. They will often come on their own or with small teams of other 
                researchers and assistants. They will do most of their planning on standard 
                Personal Compute Stone (PC). Most of these researchers are High Elves from 
                Gladeholm, between the ages of 400 to 500 years old. </p>

            <h3>Persona #2 Scenario #1</h3>
            <p>A magical researcher is looking into the connection between the Fey Wild and 
                The Crick. They originally heard about it in the Legend of the Heroes of 
                Bahumia. They are specifically trying to find the area that connects The 
                Crick to the Fey Wild. A description of the area that the Heroâ€™s found in 
                the Few Wild and the Crick can be found in the chamber of commerce site. It 
                is one of the primary sources he uses as he goes through the Living Wood to 
                try and find the portal connecting the two. </p>

            

            <h3>Persona #2 Scenario #2</h3>
            <p>The magical researcher from the previous scenario has finally received approval 
                from the Gladeholm University to begin a expedition into the Living Wood. They 
                have decided that they are going to set up a research base at The Crick. One of 
                the first thing they looked into was how they are going to find living 
                accommodations. This is actually a very simple problem, because as they will 
                find out in chamber of commerce site, all property in The Crick is community 
                property. So they are going to only need to choose a home and move in, and once 
                they do they now have the house so long as at least one person from the research 
                team stays there at all time. </p>
